J.R.R. Tolkien (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cirth)

In the fictional history of Middle-earth, the original Certhas was created by the Sindar (or Grey Elves)
for their language, Sindarin.

[...] it was adopted by Dwarves to write down both their Khuzdul language (Angerthas Moria) and
the languages of Men (Angerthas Erebor).
